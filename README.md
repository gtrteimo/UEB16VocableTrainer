# UEB16VocableTrainer

## The Assignment
This exercise is part of the Java lessons at the TFO Max Valier (highscool). To be precise this is the exercise of Chapter 16.  

The assignment we had to complete in groups of 2 students each (except that one lonely guy that noticed the fact that there is an odd number of students too late) was the to create a program that:

      - works according to the flashcard concept described in Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard)
      
      - allows you to manage several flashcards
      
      - allows you to train your language skills with several flashcards
      
      - gives you options like case sensitivity
      
      - can remind you what you haven't learned for certain time
      
      - allows to import and export flashcards.
      
      - saves data using HsqlDB (the access routines were supplied as well as some other files (net.tfobz.vokabeltrainer.model) and later modified)

      - uses java 8 and not a newer version of java
      
      - uses swing to create a GUI
      
We also had to make a mockup so we made one with Balsamiq.

## Can you use it?
You can freely use this program, modify it, copy it or if you are not a programmer suggest changes or reprt bugs. This of course within the boundries of the license described later.
If you are a programmer and want to know how exactly the program works !there are comments in the code that describe how it works and have fun.
